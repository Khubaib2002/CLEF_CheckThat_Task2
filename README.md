## CLEF CheckThat Lab Task 2: Subjectivity/Objectivity Detection using LLM

This project aimed to develop a subjectivity/objectivity detection system for news article extracts as part of the CLEF CheckThat Lab Task 2 challenge.
The dataset provided for the task consists of a collection of news article extracts, each labeled with its corresponding subjectivity or objectivity label. For our project, we made use of the English Dataset.
The dataset was augmented to make it more balanced and provide greater variety. We used RoBerta and fine-tuned it on the labeled dataset to learn to classify news article extracts as subjective or objective. The trained model is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
